Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with design, development, testing, debugging and maintenance of software applications.
    It is Important in the technology industry as it it enables innovation, efficiency and security implementation. It has driven innovation and technological advancements through transformative solutions like in the healthcare sector and the introduction of smart devices and interconnected systems through IoT. 
        

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1950s – Birth of Software Development: Early use of programming in assembly and machine languages. Key challenge being lack of structured methods
    1970s – Software Engineering as a Discipline: Formalization of Software Engineering by ACM and IEEE
    1980s – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Establishment of OOP programming languages like C++
    1990s – Agile & Web Development: Rise of web applications like Java,       JavaScript, HTML


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The phases of Software Development Includes:
    1. Planning: Involves analyzing requirements, evaluating feasibility and creating a project plan.
    2. Defining Requirements: Involves specifying all the requirements for the target Software
    3. Designing Architecture: Involves comping up with the best architecture for the software. It involves evaluating all possible factors, and choosing the most practical and logical design for the development
    4. Developing the product:This is where the fundamental development of the product is undetaken.
    5. Product testing and Integration: Testing of the software is done after development to ensure smooth execution
    6. Deployment and Maintenance: The product is then deployed to the real industrial environment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. It is sutable for projects whose requirements can change any time based on changing business needs or customer feedback. Suitable for E-commerce ans SaaS platforms with continuous updates and evolving customer needs. 
  Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order. It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes like Banking Systems and military software.  

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer: Responsible for designing, coding, and maintaining software   applications.
  Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards before     release.
  Project Manager: Oversees the project timeline, scope, and resources, ensuring   successful delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): is a software environment that provides tools to assist developers in writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently. It hs built in functions that supports with code editing, syntax highlighting, debugging and error detection. Examples is Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
  Version Control Systems (VCS): It is a tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time. It allows for collaboration among multiple developers and maintain a code history and recovery options. Examples is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technologies. Thic can be overcome by taking online courses and following industry blogs
2. Handling Tight Deadlines & Workload. This can be overcomed by use of Agile methodologies (Kanban, Scrum) to break work into manageable sections
3. Debugging and Fixing Bugs. This can be overcomed by utilizing debugging tools available in IDEs (e.g. breakpoints) and using a systematic approach to test potential fixes

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing: Testing individual components (functions, methods, or classes) in isolation. It ensures each piece of code works correctly on its own
  Integration Testing: Tests how different modules/components work together. It ensures smooth communication between integrated parts of a system. 
  System Testing: Testing the entire application as a complete system. It validates the software against functional and non-functional requirements
  Acceptance Testing: Verifies if the system meets business requirements and user expectations. It confirms whether the product is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions (e.g. ChatGPT) to generate desired outputs. Even though generative AI attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output. It is important in AI becuase it helps AI models produce relevant, accurate, precise and useful responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of vague prompt: Tell me about Climate change
Improved prompt: Define Climate Change and explain how fumes release by machines and automobiles impact climate change.
